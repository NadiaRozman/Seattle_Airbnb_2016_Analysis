# Airbnb Listings 2016 Dataset

For this project, I used the **Airbnb Listings 2016 Dataset** from Kaggle, created by [Alexander Freberg (Alex The Analyst)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexanderfreberg/airbnb-listings-2016-dataset).

It contains three sheets:
- `Listings` — property details  
- `Calendar` — daily availability and pricing  
- `Reviews` — user feedback and ratings

⚠️ **Important:** The dataset’s license is listed as **“Unknown”**, so I am not including it directly here.  

### How to Use It

1. Download the dataset from Kaggle:  
   [Airbnb Listings 2016 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexanderfreberg/airbnb-listings-2016-dataset)  
2. Save it in this `/data` folder as: Airbnb_Listings_2016.xlsx
3. Open the Tableau workbook — it will reference this dataset to show all the charts and dashboards.
