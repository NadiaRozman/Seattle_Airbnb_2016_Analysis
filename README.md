# 🏙️ Seattle Airbnb Analysis – 2016

This is a Tableau dashboard I created to explore Airbnb listings in Seattle in 2016. My goal was to understand **how prices and revenues vary across neighborhoods** and **by the number of bedrooms**, and to create a dashboard that’s clear and interactive for anyone exploring the data.

## 📊 About the Dashboard

**Title:** Seattle Airbnb Analysis – 2016  
**Tool:** Tableau Desktop / Tableau Public  
**Data Source:** See `/data/README.md`  
**Author:** Nadia Rozman

The dashboard includes:
- **Average Price per Bedroom** – to see how nightly rates change with room size  
- **Revenue Over Time** – tracking trends throughout 2016  
- **Price by ZIP Code** – geographic variation across Seattle neighborhoods  
- **Bedroom Count Distribution** – showing which property types are most common

---

## 🔍 What I Learned

- Larger listings (5–6 bedrooms) generally have the highest nightly rates  
- Revenue increased steadily in the first half of 2016, then stabilized  
- Some ZIP codes consistently show higher average prices, highlighting popular neighborhoods  
- The majority of listings are 1-bedroom properties
